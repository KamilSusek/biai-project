Application identifies handwritten letters and digits from .png files. Input files are provided by user.The specified resolution of input picture is 28x28 pixels in .png format. Applications allows user to train and test neural network on chosen data sets
(the 28x28 pixels resolution of input data is obligatory).

The application will allow user to load several files containing individual letters according to a specified standard. UI will display the message with recognized letters from given set.

Test set must be put in “testing” directory and similarly training set must be put in “training” directory. Each set must contain directories named as their record parameter (letter or digit).
